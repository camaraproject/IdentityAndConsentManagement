# v0.1.0 - Initial version

**Initial version of guidelines and documentation that represents the short-term solution agreed in this working group for accessing CAMARA APIs, to be used as a baseline.**

## Please note:

The content of the release includes:

* Identity And Consent Management approved deliverables in **documentation** folder:
  
  - **[CAMARA-API-access-and-user-consent.md](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/blob/release-0.1.0/documentation/IdentityAndConsentManagement)** - This document defines guidelines for telco operator API exposure platforms to manage CAMARA API access and user consent (when applicable). **This document is the result of the agreements reached in this working group and sets the stage for future discussions**. The major contents of the document added for this baseline release are:
    - [Glossary of Terms and Concepts](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/blob/release-0.1.0/documentation/CAMARA-API-access-and-user-consent.md#glossary-of-terms-and-concepts)
    - [Applying purpose concept in the authorization request](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/blob/release-0.1.0/documentation/CAMARA-API-access-and-user-consent.md#applying-purpose-concept-in-the-authorization-request)
    - [Authorization flows / grant types](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/blob/release-0.1.0/documentation/CAMARA-API-access-and-user-consent.md#authorization-flows--grant-types)
      - [Authorization code flow (Frontend flow)](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/blob/release-0.1.0/documentation/CAMARA-API-access-and-user-consent.md#authorization-code-flow-frontend-flow)
      - [CIBA flow (Backend flow)](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/blob/release-0.1.0/documentation/CAMARA-API-access-and-user-consent.md#ciba-flow-backend-flow)
      - [Client Credentials](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/blob/release-0.1.0/documentation/CAMARA-API-access-and-user-consent.md#client-credentials)
    - [CAMARA API Specification - Authorization and authentication common guidelines](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/blob/release-0.1.0/documentation/CAMARA-API-access-and-user-consent.md#camara-api-specification---authorization-and-authentication-common-guidelines)
  - **[CAMARA-AuthN-AuthZ-Concept.md](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/blob/release-0.1.0/documentation/CAMARA-AuthN-AuthZ-Concept.md)** - This document provides general information and generic recommendations about the authentication and authorization concept based on CAMARA scenarios. It is inherited from the original documentation of the [Commonalities WG](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/tree/main/Commonalities). It was moved to this repository in July 2023, when the Commonalities discussions started to take place in a separate Github repository: https://github.com/camaraproject/Commonalities.
