# Identity And Consent Management
Repository to describe, develop, document and test the Identity And Consent Management for CAMARA APIs

## Scope
* API providers implementing CAMARA APIs should be built with a privacy-by-default approach to fully comply with data protection regulations, such as the GDPR regulation in Europe, which emphasizes on user privacy. These regulations note that some CAMARA APIs may require user consent to be accessed. This forces the API provider to provide means and appropriate solutions to capture, store and manage this consent throughout its lifecycle. Otherwise, the scoped CAMARA APIs cannot be rolled out in production networks. Building such a solution also means bringing the identity of the user into scope and ensuring that the user experience when using the API is not compromised.
* Started: March 2023

## Release Information

* `NEW`: The "Spring25" public release of the "Identity and Consent Management" guidelines and documentation for the CAMARA APIs is available under the tag [r2.3](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/tree/r2.3).
