## Issues and PRs

| **Issue** | Owner | Description |
| ----------| ----- | ----------- |
| **Open issues** |  |  | 
| [#32](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/32) | Orange | **The concept of purpose**<br> María Garcia (TEF Privacy Team) presented the concept of purpose, in the context of current EU regulation. She also noted the role of purpose is meeting the privacy requirements inherent to Open Gateway:<br>1) purposes must be predefined and standardized by the TELCOS per each API exposed.<br>2) Only the predefined purposes can be used by the developers; if the developers do not use APIs for the indicated purposes, the established contract will be breached.<br>3) Purposes must be informed to the TELCO's customers.<br>4) Each purpose is associated with a type of lawful basis that must be standardized.<br> 5) The purpose must be exposed to the customer, as well as the right of opposition. <br><br>GSMA: question about boxes. Is it the correct order of the boxes?<br>TEF: yes, first the purpose and then the privacy team decides the corresponding lawful basis.<br><br>ORA: What is the relationship between authorized purpose and lawful basis? Is it 1:1?<br>TEF: Yes. Actualy, once the purpose is selected, the legal team will allocate the corresponding lawful basis.<br><br> VONAGE: impact on UX with regards consent capture. Also insists that the regulatory framework varies across regions. And that getting all operator compaies in CAMARA agree on the qualified lawful basis per each API will be very difficult.<br><br> DT: the concept of purpose is already in scope of Mobile Connect, with the use of OIDC.<br><br> TEF: In fact, the solution we are proposing is also based on the OAuth 2.0 and OIDC standards.<br><br>**Conclusion**: building upon points 1-5, the consortium agrees on the need to consider purposes (and their mapping into lawful basis) as an integral part of exposing Open Gateway services through CAMARA APIs, and encourages privacy/legal teams of participant operator companies to further progress on their standardization through appropriate forums, considering the regulatory frameworks of involved markets |
| [#15](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/15) | GSMA/Vonage | **Subscriber Identity API**<br>Only 5min left in the call to discuss this topic. GSMA (Mark) didn't have time to do the expected wolkthrough on GSMA's Identity API request. It is only noted that this API request will be put on hold until the ongoing analysis of CAMARA API call flows in the GSMA Open Gateway technical stream is completed, as the need for an Identity API may depend on the solution finally agreed. <br><br>**DT noted:**<br><li>The [CAMARA API roadmap request](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/pull/237) with a new Identity API should be closed and [this Identity & Consent issue](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/15) should be used to continue the discussion around this API.<li>There are comments in the CAMARA issue discussions that mention other discussions in the GSMA Open Gateway technical stream forum. It is noted that CAMARA is a public repository and participants who are not participating in the GSMA discussions may not understand the arguments being presented or what is being discussed...  An exercise in transparency is requested. |

Issue fixed. |
| [#20](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/20) ([PR#19](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/pull/19)) | Deutsche Telekom AG  | **Introduction of Github templates**<br> This issue has already been addressed in PR [#19](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/pull/19).

But it is a candidate for closure as DT and TEF are aligned on considering the use of w3c DPV and there are no other objections. |
