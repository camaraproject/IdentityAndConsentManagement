## Sub-Project kick-off
Slide deck available [here](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/blob/pr/icm-MoM-20230322/documentation/SupportingDocuments/Identity%20and%20Consent%20Sub%20Project%20kickoff.pptx). 
Chair presented background, scope and objectives of the Sub-Project. 

| Company | Comments |
| ---- | ------- | 
| **Topic: User Identity - motivation (slide 3)** | |
| Alikon, Aloaha, Sekura Mobile, Vonage | The term is likely to cause confusion. It is a wording and conceptual issue, which needs to be aligned with the on-going conversations in other Sub-Projects, e.g. QoD. |
| TEF | The attempt was to differentiate user (individual, physical person who pays the bill) from API client/consumer. Proposed to tak in terms of identifier rather than identity. |
| **Topic: User Consent - motivation (slide 4)**| |
| Sekura Mobile | There are situations where consent is not relevant at all, for example when using APIs focused on anti-fraud, e.g. SIM Swap. What is the point to ask the frauder to given consent? <br> Sekura clarified that it is needed to start with 'privacy-by-design' approach, and then seek for solutions/instruments to comply with it. Consent is one of them, but there are others. |
| TEF | In response to Sekura Mobile comment, TEF commented an alterantive use case: advertising an insurance product because your mobile has been stolen. In this case, consent is needed. If no consent, what other instrument?|
| Sekura Mobile | In response to TEF comment, Sekura clarified that there exists different 6 levels defined for lawful basis. We can make use of them as solutions/instruments, depending on the use case. Three of these level can map to the categories that TEF defines to capture consent: opt-in, out-put and automatic (legitimate interest) | 
| Vonage | Had concerns on the statement that "the consent must be <u>stored</u> in the telco operator". There's no doubt that the telco operator shall always be the data controller, but questions the mandate for being the data processor as well. For example, the telco operator can store consent in AWS/Azure/GCloud |
| Vodafone | Noted that the consent can also be delegated |
| TEF | In response to Vonage and Vodafone, TEF noted that they are aware of these options, and open to further explore it. But TEF suggested to start working on the solution wherein the telco is data processor and responsible for storing the consent. |
| Ericsson | When allowing end user to revoke consent, how to make sure that the application take action action accordingly, e.g. forgets data. How to enforce this from a contractual point of view? |
|Alikon | Commented that there exists a 3GPP defined network layer solution for consent management. References to CAPIF and edge computing solutions were mentioned. Documents and screenshots have been shared off-line using the Sub-Project mail list. |
| **Topic: Identity - way forward (slide 6)** | | 
| Vodafone | Is it MFA included? TEF nods.|
| Sekura Mobile | OIDC (add-on atop OAuth2.0) is extremely useful when user needs to be authenticated. user does not need to be authentiated (e.g., SIM Swap), and therefore OAuth2.0 is enough (no need for OIDC). Sekura remind everyone about the comments they made on the topic: identity - background (slide 3) |
| GSMA | Reminded everyone that the solution needs to work in federated environments, according to MoU (20+ signatories). They provided this example: British bank has contract with Vodafone, and needs to offer SIM Swap API to a Telefónica's subscriber.| 
| **Topic: Consent - way forward (slide 7)** | | 
| TEF | Noted the need for participants to involve their legal & privacy teams in the discussions of the topics. Consent shall not only worked out from a technical standpoint |
| Vonage | Consent topic is something to be worked by individual CSP -- don't expect CAMARA to agree on a solution for consent. Vonage noted that the regulation in force for European telcos is not the same applicable for Latam telcos, since the latter are not obliged to capture consent.  
| TEF | Disagreed with Vonage on the statement "CAMARA is not supposed to agree on a solution for consent". TEF clarified that this is precisely the main objective of this Sub-Project. TEF also noted that it is true that regulation varies across regions, though we need to agree on common tenets, by working out the purpose concept, how purpose relates to scope, etc. This needs to be consistent across all regions. Otherwise, it is possible for a developer to deploy application consistently on a global footprint, which is the main aim of CAMARA initiative. |
