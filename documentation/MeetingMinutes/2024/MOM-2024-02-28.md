## Discussion the Way Forward regarding the Profile

Axel said that we are having good discussions and comments on https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/pull/121.
There is good progress. Some topics should be tackled in their own issues referencing #121.


## Discussion about [offline-access and Refresh Token PR](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/pull/123)

Axel provided text for Offline-access for authorization code flow that Jesús said matches the GSMA text, but the CIBA related text for offline-access is TBD.

## Closing Remarks

Axel kindly asked participants to comment on issues and to review PRs and most importantly contribute text changes to PR.
WGs thrive only if members become participants. So, again please participate. Please comment and review.
